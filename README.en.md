# WebStudio Project #2 of 8

## Description
The WebStudio project is an example website for a virtual creative agency, designed as a homework assignment. This project focuses on showcasing the services offered by the studio, its portfolio, contact information, and the team.

## Technologies
The project was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML5 - for the structure of the page
- CSS3 - for styling the page

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single `index.html` page that contains all necessary sections, and a `styles.css` file that defines the appearance of the page.

### HTML
The `index.html` page contains a semantic structure using tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc. This makes the page more accessible and more understandable for search engines.

### CSS
The `styles.css` file contains optimized style rules that determine the appearance of the page. This styling is based on CSS variables, which facilitates the management of colors and fonts throughout the project. The CSS code has been optimized by grouping selectors, using shorthand properties, and avoiding repetitions.

## Installation
To run the project locally, simply clone the repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Piotrek92PL/goit-markup-hw-02.git
Then, you can open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the page.
